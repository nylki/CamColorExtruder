CamColorExtruder
================

CamColorExtruder is a project realised with the openFrameworks framework.
Using your webcam it identifies areas of certain color and extrudes them as 3D-Boxes.
You can switch colors by pressing 'r', 'g', 'b'.
Pressing 'x' enables custom color picking: drag/click with your mouse at color you'd like to extrude.

# Install
Clone the repo into your oF app directory and run `make`.
